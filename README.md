# PoPS_API

> Backend Component to PoPs



## Requirements

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Start docker

```
docker-compose up
```

> If you have trouble connecting to mongodb run the following with the previous docker containers still running.
```
docker-compose restart
```
This should connect you for now until this bug is fixed.

The api should now be running on [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)

# Don't worry about this unless you are making changes to the Dockerfile
